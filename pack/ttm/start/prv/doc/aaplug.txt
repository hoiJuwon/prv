Plugin for enhancing your life

This plugin is meant to help you keep track of what
you are doing. This might be very helpful in fine-tuning
efforts, but also is very obviously useful when tackling
complex tasks.

                                                                       F

            *aa-mappings*
<Space>a
        write a one-line shout
<Space>A
        write an arbitrary shout in your shouts file
<Space>s
  start an AA session :S X Y with Y slots of X minutes

            *aa-commands*
*:A* {shout}
        Add a shout

*:S* {dur} {nslots}
        Start a session.
        {dur} is the duration of a slot in minutes.
        {nslots} is the number of slots in the session.

The funcionality of the AA plugin is centered around these
two commands.
The idea is to send one shout each slot, as a way to keep
a record of the dedication.
More shouts are often useful as notes and enhanced records.

            *aa-settings*
This plugin doesn't have any settings.
'asdasd' is very cool

|aa-settings| is good for you

*asdasd* is the best ever

            *aa-todo*
TODO:
* Tags should not collide. How to find out all the tags defined by the system?
* Routines to send shouts to cloud (SQl, MondDB or RDF preferably)
* arrumar doc
* fazer o resto dos comandos e mapeamentos
* soltar no github talvez vim.org
* ver no doxigen com fazem com vimL
* usar o enter para criar direto o caminho.
* talvez espaco-enter para decorar (link, tag, ref-tag, ref-option ref-command ref-func)
* relacionar bem com a ideia de reactwiki (hypertexto com codigos executaveis)
