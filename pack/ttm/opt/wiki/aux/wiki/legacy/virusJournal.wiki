Self-dismantling in social experiments: anthropological physics and technoxamanic heys (ebós)

== abstract ==
Both mythological and hacker histories have recognized roles for self-dismantling:
it protects the messenger, allows the detachment of the self from self image,
is an artistic technique, etc.
Brazil has a pronounced role in this context, for it yields religious freedom since
the colonization and beforehand, and holds a renowned and visceral hacker behavior:
the kludge culture (aka. 'cultura da gambiarra').
This article exposes this legacy by two means: the description of social experiments
made by many participants at once, memorials of images, videos, texts, music, webpages, groups,
avatars/nicks/pseudonyms, presentations, etc.
This text is itself an experiment, and will be fed back to the community for comments before publishing,
as usual with any \emph{anthropological physics} experiment.
The materials herein are no secret, and are usually not unpublished, although most of it have not been
bind to a DOI or an ISBN.
Further directions are given as seminal ideas because next steps will be given
by the community upon diverse interests and context stonework.
