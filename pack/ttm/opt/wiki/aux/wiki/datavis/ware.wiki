cap 5

color blindness
∴ superfluous in modern life
extremely useful in data visualization
camouflage antithesis:
  Fig 4.1
  hunter-gatherers

ecology -> information display / VD
  color as attribute rather than primary characteristic
  pref. labeling categorization
  unpref. shape, detail, spatial layout

= Trichromacy Theory =
3 cones in retina active at normal light levels
rods, for low light levels, ignored in color perception
3 cones -> 3 dimensions in human color vision space (aka. color space)

liquid crystal: RGB
primary paint: R Yellow B
minimal three inks: Cyan Magenta Yellow

chicken: 12 color-sensitive cels

'cone sensitivity functions'
Fig 4.2
S/blue less sensitive:
reason (besides chromatic aberration, discussed in Chap 2)
not to show detailed info (such as text) in pure blue in a black background.

mix only three colors, aka. primaries, to get any 'particular patch',
∴ any color,
∴ only the response of the receptors matter, the spectrum may be any.

== color blindness ==
~10% male, 1% female have color vision deficiency.
protanopia, deuteranopia, 

2-dimensional color spaces in common color deficiencies

= Color Measurement =
the basis of colorimetry:
one may match any color with no more than three primary lights

colorimetry is essential for specifying and reproducing colors

C ≡ rR + gG + bB

≡ is perceptual match

Fig 4.4
Fig 4.5

'gamut': the set of colors in the 'color space'
(either produced or sensed by a system)
YBP smaller gamut then RGB

negative light (r, g, b values):
  allows one to say that any color might be matched by three distinct lights
  is equivalent to adding the light to the reference color. 

'non-physical primaries' ?

== change of primaries ==
RGB is not special, primaries are arbitrary for color mixture

fundamental is color space conversion,
change from one set of primaries to another

transformation on color spaces: Appendix A

'abstract primaries'
for color specification

'standard observer'

CIE system of color standards
serious color specification
measurements made prior to 1931. (revision?)
(using class filters derived from the standard observer)

tristimulus calues, abstract receptors XYZ of an abstract observer.
Y is luminance
XYZ are mathematically convenient transformations of measured sensitivities
Appendix B has details on how the system is derived

XYZ gamut is beyond physically realizable colors

Use CIEtri to convert between primary spaces

surface colors, pigments, illuminant

== chromaticity coordinates ==
lightness, or luminance, should be treated specially (see Chap 3)

chromaticity <--> tristimulus

chromaticity diagram (only CIE?):
  mix of two colors lie on the line
  triangles in the diagram
  spectrum locus? same as chromaticity coordinate?
  purple boundary
  white, illuminants: D65, A
  excitation purity (saturation)
  complementary wavelengths/colors

sRGB (vs RGB?)

Eq 4.7 to find the CIE tristimulus values

calibrate monitor's R, G, B outputs and apply gamma correction
(see Chap 3).
Monitor then is a linear color creation device with a particular set
of primaries
(self-calibrating monitors)

=== color differences and uniform color spaces ===
color distances match euclidean distance
(specification of tolerance, of color codes, pseudocolor sequences)

CIE XYZ, CIElab, CIEluv

Eq. 4.8, 4.9, 4.10

UCS diagram (for CIEluv)
blends of two colors still lie on the line in u', v' diagram
(luv is a projective transformation of XYZ)
(mix not in line for CIElab!!)

u*, v* scale u', v' by distance from black to white
JND in ∆E

Uniform color spaces provide only rough approximations

:rec: use more saturated colors for small areas;
use less saturated colors for large areas.
