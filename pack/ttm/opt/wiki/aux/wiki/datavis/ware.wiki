color blindness
∴ superfluous in modern life
extremely useful in data visualization
camouflage antithesis:
  Fig 4.1
  hunter-gatherers

ecology -> information display / VD
  color as attribute rather than primary characteristic
  pref. labeling categorization
  unpref. shape, detail, spatial layout

= Trichromacy Theory =
3 cones in retina active at normal light levels
rods, for low light levels, ignored in color perception
3 cones -> 3 dimensions in human color vision space (aka. color space)

liquid crystal: RGB
primary paint: R Yellow B
minimal three inks: Cyan Magenta Yellow

chicken: 12 color-sensitive cels

'cone sensitivity functions'
Fig 4.2
S/blue less sensitive:
reason (besides chromatic aberration, discussed in Chap 2)
not to show detailed info (such as text) in pure blue in a black background.

mix only three colors, aka. primaries, to get any 'particular patch',
∴ any color,
∴ only the response of the receptors matter, the spectrum may be any.

== color blindness ==
~10% male, 1% female have color vision deficiency.
protanopia, deuteranopia, 

2-dimensional color spaces in common color deficiencies
