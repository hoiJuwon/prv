in English?
find the colors we want to use. (as in the ic videos)
software to install:
- ipython3
- pil
- realcolors
- Vim compiled with python3 support from latest git version :vim:
  - clone prv repo to executable directory
  - start vim with ./vim
  - test this! and give the recipe

exercises: :ex:
- create colors
- color schemes
- palletes
- free image design
  - use templates created in the class
  - see the procedures and explanations on the video version of the class
- enhance ptbr article on PIL:
  - https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_Imaging_Library
  - use:
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_Imaging_Library
    - https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en

parts:
- motivation: color variation yields images and vision in general.
  - stereoscopy
    - magic eye
    - 3d movies, animations (make with pil)
    - 3d pictures of class mates :ex:
      - same class mates, different angles
      - different classmates, same faces (e.g. laughing)
    - 3d video conference (with ric)
    - 3d live art, enhanced telepresence
  - syntax highlighting
    - realcolors :ex: maybe put online with vimjs
    - toki pona
    - aa
  - art (gombrich)
  - data visualization
  - books on colors in dataviz, philosofy, physics, etc.
- one color: what is a color, one color picture.
- two colors: two colors: contrast, threshold of differentiation, tests
- three colors
- four colors
- five colors
- beyond
- programming for colors:
  - PIL:
    - color space conversion
    - affine transforms
    - statistical analysis
    - effects: contrast enhancements, filtering (convolution kernels), point operations, saturation (see image magick menu when Image.show(), details).
    - make thelema-related symbols (salt, sulfur, mercury, 5 elements, etc)
- color and sound:
  - correspondence by frequency in audible and visible spectrum:
    - animation in linear progression
    - exponential progression
    - logarithmic progression
    - power law
  - artistic pieces:
    - with my own will, with sync and without sync of sound and colors
    - visualize: https://soundcloud.com/bernardobarros/sets/surface-of-inscription/s-AhsCH
    - REM movement, psicoactive experiment
    - versinus++: ppl asked to write versinus, and then versinus++

== todo ==
- read articles
- read books:
  - ./munzner
- make realcolors ok
- write class
- make stereoscopic 3d animations
- Ask Cristina to write students and ask them to install
realcolors and cheese or similar software.
- make artistic pieces :art:

= notes =
White, gray and black are colors.
At the same time, one might say
that white, gray and black have no color.
This second sense is called chromaticity
in color science (and VD).
When the 'color' of white, gray and black
is none, absent, zero or nonsense,
one is talking about chromaticity.

chromaticity is a dimension/attribute/channel of color.
It might be embedded in all three dimensions, such as in RGB.
There are infinite pairs of two other attributes beyond chromaticity.

cor é sinestésica, usar o exemplo da ilusao ótica,
e argumentar pela visao ser fruto da variação de cor.

ask not if one likes music or color, it makes little sense
to ask something you know it is true.
