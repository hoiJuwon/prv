~~ tracks ~~

0) sent as his self-compilation tracks of the "Originais do Sample",
  which I uploaded here:
  https://archive.org/details/originaisDoSample
    I found no specific order among the pieces.
    If this is an unpublished work, it might not be
    in accordance with the self-compilation proposal,
    but is a decent enough album to be an exception.

1) 02-after branco
    a very interesting improvisation-like, calm, instrumental, beafutiful melody
    blend of background nostalgic vinil noise with traditional and popular instruments

2) canela
    cuíca, voices, keyboard, bass, guitar, moderate singing

3) dragon
    is a binary freak show with a guitar
    synth-like sound and synths
    
4) pancadao do bem
    a quasi-xuxa carioca funk with
    lá-lá-lá, tells the story of a harridam who brews coffee
    on the underwear and uses black and red
    ~~~ i am going to remix you ~~~ ("eu vô te sampleá")

5) RemixOn
    is funny and "saracutiante", cheerful.
    It holds a non-important but entertaining narrative,
    wile mixing popular instruments, rhythms, and declamation.
    should be the first piece in this collection because
    it opens a presentation, as in a rodeo.

6) rio samba show
    quasi-samba.
    show yes. Carnival?
    frevo-flavour saracutiaçaum
    ah, no cuíca here? 1m
    ow yeah, 1m25s
    saracuteia irmaum

7) wilsoriginal
    electro-samba-rock
    mushy thick-thuck-thack-théck, nice


~~~ beyond self-compilation ~~~

A) more stuff, DJ sets it seems.
Need to ask more about it.

~~~ questions ~~~

do you have higher quality files for the case
when someone wants to make a remix?

do you write? draw?

should I reorder the pieces in order to make for a different
sequence? E.g. RemixOn might be the first.
(for me it is quite fine as is.)
