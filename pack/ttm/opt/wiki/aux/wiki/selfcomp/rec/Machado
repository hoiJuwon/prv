~~ tracks ~~

0) sent as his self-compilation tracks of the "Originais do Sample",
  which I uploaded here:
  https://archive.org/details/originaisDoSample
      I found no specific order among the pieces.
      If this is an unpublished work, it might not be
      in accordance with the self-compilation proposal,
      but is a decent enough album to be an exception.

1) 02-after branco
      a very interesting improvisation-like, calm, instrumental, beautiful melody
      blend of background nostalgic vinyl noise with traditional and popular instruments

2) canela
      cuíca, voices, keyboard, bass, guitar, moderate singing

3) dragon
      is a binary freak show with a guitar
      synth-like sound and synths
    
4) pancadao do bem
      a quasi-xuxa carioca funk with
      lá-lá-lá, tells the story of a harridan who brews coffee
      on the underwear and uses black and red
      ~~~ i am going to remix you ~~~ ("eu vô te sampleá")

5) RemixOn
      is funny and "saracutiante", cheerful.
      It holds a non-important but entertaining narrative,
      wile mixing popular instruments, rhythms, and declamation.
      should be the first piece in this collection because
      it opens a presentation, as in a rodeo.

6) rio samba show
      quasi-samba.
      show yes. Carnival?
      frevo-flavour saracutiaçaum
      ah, no cuíca here? 1m
      ow yeah, 1m25s
      saracuteia irmaum

7) wilsoriginal
      electro-samba-rock
      mushy thick-thuck-thack-théck, nice


~~~ beyond self-compilation ~~~

A) more stuff, DJ sets it seems.
Need to ask more about it


~~ about Machado ~~

DJ, software developer, social entrepreneur, makes parties and people dance,
free software outcast wannabe


~~~ questions ~~~

do you have higher quality files of these pieces for us to remix?

do you write? draw?

should I reorder the pieces to make a different
sequence? E.g. RemixOn might be the first
(for me it is quite fine as is)
