~~ tracks of :first: self-compilation ../rel/001 ~~

1- Interlude nº 1 pour Olga
(eletroacústica)
  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Be7lWO-tS9Y
    as in trap and dubstep, this piece only catches me after the first 1m.
    electronic, eletro-cello electro-organ sounds.

2- DANÇA DA MULHER VERMELHA
(eletroacústica)
Balé eletrônico de
A CARTOMANTE
Ópera em 3 atos de Jorge Antunes
  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t0GGqGndlk
    this piece is without orchesta.
    I miss the lirics, i cannot understand all of it
    Beautiful maternal pulse around 8m

3-MIXOLYDIA
(Lydia Kavina, theremin)
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2u4767Ertk
    ow this piece is a delight.
    around 2m30s it catched me.
    listen carefully for this marvelous piece and performance.
    4m, r++
    the piece gets even better as it goes on to 8m-10m.
    and then more appealing, a pity he does not explore the rythms more. r++

4- Maracatuzinho da Mariuga: 
  https://youtu.be/7yIs16eLBkU
    piano piece, maracatu-inspired with freaky electronics
    Helena Elias (piano)
    cute piece, I want more

5- Frevinho da Sônia
piano: Alexandre Dias
  https://youtu.be/KdX4V_1E2Y
    and here is more as well.
    very nice pure instrumental music
    music of dots ("música de bolinha")
    I got curious about the techniques used, how would Antunes describe it

6- Modinha do Amaral
piano: Alexandre Dias
  https://youtu.be/YNmg_YaomUI
    another pure piano music (no electronics, not prepared).
    the video could have the sheet roll with the music, a pity .
    the techniques, how would he describe

7- ELEGIA VIOLETA PARA MONSENHOR ROMERO (Final)
  https://youtu.be/u6MkKNhFYts
    this is a fantastic musical piece.
    the video is also worth the time.
