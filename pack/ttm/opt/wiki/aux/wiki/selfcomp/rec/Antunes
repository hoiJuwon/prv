~~ tracks ~~

the self/autocompilation:
  1- Interlude nº 1 pour Olga
  (eletroacústica)
  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Be7lWO-tS9Y
      as in trap and dubstep, this piece only catches me after the first 1m.
      electronic, eletro-cello electro-organ sounds.

  2- DANÇA DA MULHER VERMELHA
  (eletroacústica)
  Balé eletrônico de
  A CARTOMANTE
  Ópera em 3 atos de Jorge Antunes
  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t0GGqGndlk
      this piece is without orchesta.
      I miss the lirics, i cannot understand all of it
      Beautiful maternal pulse around 8m

  3-MIXOLYDIA
  (Lydia Kavina, theremin)
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2u4767Ertk
      ow this piece is a delight.
      around 2m30s it catched me.
      listen carefully for this marvelous piece and performance.
      4m, r++
      the piece gets even better as it goes on to 8m-10m.
      and then more appealing, a pity he does not explore the rythms more. r++

  4- Maracatuzinho da Mariuga: 
  https://youtu.be/7yIs16eLBkU
      piano piece, maracatu-inspired with freaky electronics
      Helena Elias (piano)
      cute piece, I want more
      (he sent more by private chat)

  5- Frevinho da Sônia
  piano: Alexandre Dias
  https://youtu.be/KdX4V_1E2Y
      and here is more as well.
      very nice pure instrumental music
      music of dots ("música de bolinha")
      I got curious about the techniques used, how would Antunes describe it

  6- Modinha do Amaral
  piano: Alexandre Dias
  https://youtu.be/YNmg_YaomUI
      another pure piano music (no electronics, not prepared).
      the video could have the sheet roll with the music, a pity .
      the techniques, how would he describe

  7- ELEGIA VIOLETA PARA MONSENHOR ROMERO (Final)
  https://youtu.be/u6MkKNhFYts
      this is a fantastic musical piece.
      the video is also worth the time.
