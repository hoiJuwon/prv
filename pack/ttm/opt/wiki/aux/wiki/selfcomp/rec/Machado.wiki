2) More stuff, DJ sets it seems.
Need to ask more about it.

In 1) I found no specific order among the pieces.
If this is an unpublished work, it is not
in accordance with the self-compilation proposal,
but is a decent enough album to be an exception.

dragon is a binary freak show with a guitar

pancadao do bem: a quasi-xuxa carioca funk with
lá-lá-lá tells the story of a harridam who brews coffee on the underwear and uses black and red

RemixOn is funny and "saracutiante", cheerful.
It holds a non-important but entertaining narrative wile mixing popular instruments, rhythms, and declamation.
