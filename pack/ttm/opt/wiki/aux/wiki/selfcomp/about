~ the selfcomp recod label ~

selfcomp is dedicated to self-compilations,
i.e. selections of musical / sonic pieces
by the authors.
Ideally, each record is a livelong compilation
made by the author himself.
As an EP or LP, i.e. between some minutes to not much more than an hour.
In practice, it is whatever the author wants.
