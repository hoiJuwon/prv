~~ ../about ~~

selfcomp label (or directory, or collections...)
holds a collection os self-compilations,
i.e. collections of pieces made by the authors themselves.


~~~ about release ./001 ~~~

i started digging for new materials, to find new/recent/ongoing art stuff.
Looking mainly for music, too many good pieces came to me by
people I wanted to hear from.

please understand that these albums are the result of dedicated
lives, listen carefully, comment here or in private messages about
the pieces and collections.

AFAIK, the time and attention of the authors are devoted
to finding the best in art and delivering the best art they can
to themselves and you,
often with care, kindness and good will.


~~~ more about selfcomp and ./001 ~~~

selfcomp started by looking for individual summaries,
for lifelong collections of media

ideally it still is, but each artist has its phases and goals,
and whatever they deliver to me i absorb.
I ask and try to keep the compilations cognizable
in a timespan between 10-60 minutes.

also, looking also for texts, images, videos,
and receiving multimedia links,
self-compilations of other media is being
gathered, such as os texts, images, animations,
videos.

Glerm and Antunes albums are unbelievable, 
Machado and Basbaum albums are amusing,
Martigli and Gularte albumns are unanticipated.


~~~ release 002 ? ~~~

as can be seen in the ../index,
other artists sent nice materials.
