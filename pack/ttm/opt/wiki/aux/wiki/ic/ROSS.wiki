'generalized information theories'
(possibility and evidence theories)

excluded middle axiom
axiom of contradiction

# 1
precision and uncertainty
(add quantum mechanichs quotes,
add bible and other mithological literature.)

complexity of systems and uncertainty

precision, information and complexity

fuzzyness is one of the types of uncertainty we find everywhere

## case for fuzzyness
dinossours 90,000,006 year ago..
(add precise to imprecise is foolish)
recipe and calories and vitamins etc

a Proust sentence is 326 words long 

deal with imprecision to aleviate costs,
exploit our tolerance for imprecision.

## a historical perspective
statistical mechanics

calculus considered no uncertanty

" :Question uncertainty and imprecision: synonyms?

probability theory captures random uncertainty

association of credible solutions with the amount of uncertainty

Max Black (1937), Zadeh (1965)

Cardano ~1500, Bishop of Wells 1685

Bernoulli 1713, Moivre 1738, Bayes 1763,
Laplace 1774

Bayes 1763 -> assessment of subjective probabilities
human's degree of belief within sublective probability theory

Lukasiewicz ~1930 multivalued discrete logic
Dempster 1967 theory of evidence (assessment of ignorance, abcence of
information)
Zadeh 1965 fuzzy seet theory (continuous-valued logic)
Shafer 1975 complete theory of evidence (info from more then one
source)
Zadeh ~??? possibility theory from special cases of fuzzy sets
~1980- relation between evidence, probability and possibility theory
by means of monotone measures (former fuzzy measures)

unertainty oposed to information

prob with little info -> ill-posed, complex or not sufficielty known

" :Idea use the edX course on ignorance to harness uncertainty, not
only deal with it like it is proposed in the book.
E.g. how to measure the usefulness of potentiality of the uncertainty,
or ignorance, of a system or problem?

fuzzy, vague, ambiguous, ignorance, etc

Zadeh, return soon is vague , return in a few minutes in fuzzy

Mack 1937 about inexactㄣess of mathematical formulations for real phenomena
Quine 1981 table and not table by one molecule

de Finetti 1974 probability does not exist, it is a subjective
description of a person's uncertainty... Be normative, not descriptive..

## the utility of fuzzy systems

they are universal aproximators

isomorphism between (abstract and linear algebra) and (the structures
of a fuzzy system)

FS : action/antecedent -> (implies) -> conclusion/consequent

input group (?) to output group (?)

Stone-Wierstrass theorem is fundamental for fuzzy systems

" :Q define fuzzy system, logic, set etc?

fuzzy has all that algebra has to offer + handles not only numerical
quantities

fuzzy systems are most useful not for being universal approximators
to algebraix functions, but to approximate behavior in which analytic
functions and numerical relations do not exist.

handles when there are vague, ambiguous or not known inputs

(1) when behaviors are not well understood,
(2) when an approximate and fast solution is warranted

fuzzy systems are robust

spherical chicken clucking

## limitations of fuzzy systems
shallow/deductive and deep/inductive reasoning, models, logic

ill-defined problems and deep reasoning

El Farol problem by Arthur 1994

## the illusion: ignoring uncertainty and accuracy
prob and fuzzy sets only differ in one of 16 axioms
(logics of uncertainty)

Gaines -> valuation on a lattece of propositions
+ excluded middle -> prob logic
+ strong truth-functionality -> fuzzy logic

random errors aværage out
nonrandom errors will generally not average out
they both migh be quantifieѕ, but only
nonrandom errors might be redㄩced with addition information.

statist -> statistics

ind rand vars and
noninteractive sets

## uncertainty and information

"information is the resolution of uncertainty"
Claude Shannon

## fuzzy sets and membership
set membership

ppl 6 feet tall

membership function

degrees of membership in [0,1]

fuzzy vs crisp sets

a fuzzy set might have an inf num of memb fun
a crisp set has only one memb fun
crisp set inсs a special case of fuzzy sets

"Fuzzy sets are always functions"
that maps a universe of objects (X) to [0,1]
The fuzzy set H is the fun \mu_H

every fun that X -> [0,1] is a fuzzy set
but beyond math, it is a FS iff it matches
some intuitively plausible
semantic description of imprecise properties.

## chance vs fuzzyness
95% of being above 7 feet or healthy liquid, against
very tall or .95 membership in the class of healthy liquid.

"fuzzyness describes the lack of distinction of an event,
whereas chance describes the uncertanty in the occurence of the
event."

disc, cylinder and rod through d/h
right circular cylinder

aproximate circle C\_~  (fuzzy set)
membership function \mu\_{C\_~} of the C\_~

## intuition of uncertainty: fuzzy versus probability
y = sin(x)
x is uncertain
model thourgh probability density function
and a fuzzy set membership function

propagation of error:
- derived distributions (in probability theory)
- extension principle (in fuzzy set theory)

extension principle (by Zadeh) used æxtensively in the area of fuzzy
arithmetic

":T learn the derived distributions (method or propagation or whatnot)

from uniform x -> saddle for prob dens fun, uniform for fuzzy set memb

":N eqs 1.4 - 1.8b are messy: from initial logic wiggle in 1.4 to final
y(?) instead of f(y) in 1.8a,b TTM

## sets as points in hypercubes
suzzy set A\_~ on a Universe X

power set of the universe with 2^n elements
(with full membership (vs empty membership?))

special note on points: (1,1,1...) whole set,
(0,0,0...) null set, (.5,.5,.5....) maximum fuzziness.

value set V{P(X)}

## Summary
two kinds of information
(or uncertainty which is the opposite of information?)
fuzzy membership functions: similarities of objects with regards to a set of properties
probabilities: relative frequencies

fuzzy models are not replacements for probability models

every crisp set is fuzzy
converse is not true

"the efficacy of a model in solving a problem should be the only
criterion used to judge that model"


# 2

universe of discourse

" :Q membership -> pertencimento?

"crisp sets are special cases of fuzzy sets,
they are sets without ambiguity in their
membership (i.e. they are sets
with unambiguous boudaries)"

### classical sets
sets, subsets
cardinality and whole sets

notation for contained, contained or equal
and equivalent sets

null sets
whole sets has two conflicting definitions
(one given two paragraphs after the other,
error?).

null set -> impossible event
whole set -> certain event
power sets

### operations on classical sets
union of sets -> logical or
another union -> exclusive or
A | B -> difference between A and B

### properties of classical (crisp) sets
Commutativity   2
Associativity   2
Distributivity  2
Idempotency     2
Identity        4
transitivity    1
involution      1
               ---
               14
d morgans       2
excluded middle 2
               ---
               18

excluded middle axioms
axioms of the excluded middle, axiom of contradiction

(soh usam interseccao, unicao e complemento)
(involution, excluded middle axioms and de morgans
are the only that use complements)

### mapping of classical sets to functions

" :Presentation use the three elements set to make all operations.
state how it happens for larger sets.

"mapping is important in relating set-theoretic and function-theoretic
representations of information"

characteristic (indicator) function

any set -> a function theoretic set (at least one?)
value set V(A)

union, intersection,  complement, containment
through max/min (or/and) 

## Fuzzy sets
elements have varying degrees of membership.
" :Question fuzzy set is a function AND a counter-domain or domain (?)

Universe of membership values

notation convention for
universes of discourse:
discrete and finite,
constinuous and infinite.
(function-theoretic aggregations or collections)
function-theoretic agreggation operator

" :Note universe of discouse is domain. Universe membership values is image

### fuzzy set operation
standard fuzzy operations
for each element, function-theoretic operations
Union, intersection, complement

contained in any set, whole a null sets

the cardinality of the fuzzy power set is infinite

Union, intersection, complement

contained in any set, whole a null sets

the cardinality of the fuzzy power set is infinite

Union, intersection, complement

contained in any set, whole a null sets

the cardinality of the fuzzy power set is infinite
" :Question what about discrete, finite fuzze sets?

De Morgan's principles

excluded middles axioms are not satistied

" :Errata equation 2.25c
" :Errata figure 2.16, caption b

### properties of fuzzy sets
"the same as crispy"
(only the excluded middle that don't)
(commutativity, associativity, distributivity,
identity, transitivity, involution)

examples in a two fuzzy set,
each with two variables problem

" :E in the example of the discrete fuzzy sets, De Morgan's principle
that (IS) mixed with an amine

noninteractive fuzzy sets
(combining membership functions of different universes in an
orthogonal form)

### Alternative fuzzy set operations
standard fuzzy operations
t-norms t-conorms (for intersections and unions)
(triangular n cn, Menger 1942)

special significance of t-norms and t-conorms

aggregation operations
averaging operations
(dont exist in classical set theory,
thus fuzzy logic is much more expressive
to manipulate empirical data and intuitive aspects.)

## Summary
the excluded middle axiom constrains reasoning

noninteractivity // independence

norms for intersections, unions and complements
