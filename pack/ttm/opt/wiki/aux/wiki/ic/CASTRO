# Foreword

# Preface

three branches of natural computing

Read ap B before starting the first chap

linear systems have coputing power limited to second-order statistics

ICAs para remoção de ruído?

# Apendix B
this appendix has lots of errors, so it is useful to
remmember things but not for learning.

These are the topics which I found not clear:
* Self-adjoint, hermitian
* Hilbert spaces
* Turing machines (universal, deterministic etc)
* Computational complexity (complexity theory)

# B4.1
objective, cost, or criterion function
search space, feasible solution

garantee and speed of convergence
convergence to a good solution

global and local solutions

# B4.2
check propositional (zeroth order logic)
first order and second order logic.


# Chap 1
## 1.1.
-> taxonomy of natural computaing divided into three:
computing inspired by nature,
simulation and emulation of natural phenomena in computers,
computing with natural materials.

1.1.1
wetware?

1.3
it cand be advantageous to highlight the minimal features necessary to enable
some particular aspects of a system to be reproduced and to observe some emergent properties.
"if it is possible to do something using simple techniques, why use more complicated ones?"

1.4.1
"Among all natural computing approaches, computational algorithms and sys-
tems inspired by nature are the oldest and most popular ones."

Computing inspired by nature,
simulation of nature,
bio-inspired computing, biologically motivated computing, computing with biological metaphors.

McCulloch and Pitts

invididuals capable of reproduction, subject to genetic variation and natural selection:
genetic algorithms, evolution strategies, evolutionary programming, genetic programming,
classifier systems

int de enxame: late 1980's, celullar robotic systems in which a collection of simple agents in an environment interact bases on local rules.
nowadays: any attemp to design algorithms or problem-solving devices inspired by the collectiove behavior of social organisms (social insects, cultures and sociocognition.

Artificial immune systems (AIS) or immunocomputing.

1.4.2
artificial life and .. fractal geometry of nature

for modelling fractal patterns and structures:
cellular automata, L-systems or Lindenmayer systems,
interated function systems, particle systems, Brownian motion

Alife, 'strong Alife'

1.4.3
molecular computing
quantum computing or computation

1.5
brute force or exaustive search

Problems
--------
Occam's razor

## 2.1
"most of these concepts are made up of ‘slippery’ words;
words whose meaning can be different under different domains and words
whose definitions are not available or agreed upon yet."

chapter about conceptualization

### 2.1.1
models and metaphors

### 2.1.2
branches of natural computing and respective roots on biological or
natural phenomena (pag 30)

## 2.2
### 2.2.1
individuals, agents, entities, components (synonyms)

agents (and definitions in the literature)

### 2.2.2
parallel and distributed operations of individual entities.
parallel-distributed systems
parallel distributed processing (PDP)
PDP networks such as ANN

### 2.2.3

interactions

(direct) connectionism
(indirect) stigmergy/estigmergia

### 2.2.4

learning 

"learning does not depend purely on consciousness
and also does not require a brain." pag 37

evolution
"The outcome of evolution, like the outcome of learning, is a better
adaptabil-
ity to life and the environment."

### 2.2.5
positive and negative feedback

### 2.2.6
"Self-
organization may also go by the name ‘emergent structuring’,
‘self-assembly’,
‘autocatalysis’, and ‘autopoiesis’, though most of these concepts have
some
slight differences to the self-organization concept provided here"

SOSs:
collectivity and interactivity
dynamics
Emergent patterns
nonlinearities
complexity
rule-based
feedback loops

####
alternatives to self-organization:
following a leader
blueprint
recipe
templates

### 2.2.7

###
"a complex system is a system featuring a large number
of interacting components whose aggregate activity is nonlinear (not
derivable
by summing the behavior of individual components) and typically
exhibit self-
organization" pag 44

complexity vs redutionism

"The five basic forms of investigating complex systems have already
been dis-
cussed (Section 2.1.1), namely, experimentation, simulation,
theoretical model-
ing, emulation, and realization."

Complex adaptative systems (CAS)

interactions, diversity, adaptation
