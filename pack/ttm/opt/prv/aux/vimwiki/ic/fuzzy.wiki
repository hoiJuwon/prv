= intro fuzzy =
- conjuntos fuzzy e crispy
- indeterminação

= fuzzy vs prob =
* A honest question.
* partial membership, ambiguity on the classification (fundamental
  difference)
* operations on fuzzy sets (diff gets evident)
* The consideration of classifiers and regression output as fuzzy sets
(the values, most often interpreted as probabilities,
yield memberships.
These are fuzzy interpretations of probabilistic values,
which might be sound or at least yield reasonable results.)
