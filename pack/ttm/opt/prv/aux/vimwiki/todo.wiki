ok abracadabra man.
lets see...

* I am a garanton
  - Yes you are
  - So you are too.

So lets see how you go now...
write the tutorial on using realcolors,
  - make a colorscheme on the fly (start vim session, open any file, change usual colors,
    then change ft=vimwiki, change the colors of bullets. Then open a python or help file.
    Show the person how to save and load such colorschemes.)
      * on the first phase:
	      * vim .
	      * tabe
	      * make screen bigger with c-+
	      * write 'lets make a color scheme on the fly to suit my taste, mood and intentions'
	      * c-\ i initializes
	      * c-\ s shows the syntax group
	      * c-\ c shows hex rep of colors and enables the change of them
another for using aa,
another for using toki pona,
and another on using vim in the prv framework.

fazer o aa fumegar no vim corretamente
Urgente:
- Escrever p Cristina sobre a apresentcao, era para termos mandado
  hoje e ela disse q ficaria atribulada c o comeco das aulas
    * Citar o Google Summer of Code q divulgou as orgs mentoras h√° pouco
      - alunos de p√≥s podem participar. Alunos de graduacao, mestrado e doutorado. Pode acumular com bolsas brasileiras.

- fazer vim package template, com os arquivos todos que tenho na
  arvore ~/.vim/, mas no caminho do pacote.
  Sei q after/ n eh recursivo. Testar em /pack/packgroup/start/pack/
  e opt/
  (mais algum? acho q n tem)

- integrate aa with Vim
- integrate music with Vim
- review notes in vimrc, in wiki (and clean it!), and in other docs.
- finish article
- review docs and scripts
- upload scripts to vim.org

- send Vim and tokipona articles for publishing
  * make results section in Vim article
  * upload Vim article to arXiv
  * review tokipona article
  * upload tokipona article to arXiv
  * send Vim artice for publication
  * send tokipona article for publication
- send inequality and losd articles to arXiv, to force me to take some measures about these stuck documents.
- Check maths for flowers (phyllotaxis): https://www.datacamp.com/projects/62?utm_medium=fb%2Cig%2Can%2Cms-all&utm_source=fb_paid&utm_campaign=smartly_ppa&utm_id=5a85d82ac7e28c10880b34a5 Phyllotaxis: Draw flowers using mathematics
- organize repositores:
  * vimrc goes where?
  * realcolors goes where?
  * prv goes where?
  * vimwiki goes where?
  * (tokipona is in its own repo with python)
  * there are two repos at least:
    * ttm/vim     |    join them? (with vimrc and realcolors and article and more)
    * ttm/prv     |               (with bot, aa, vim python and rdf hacks)
    * put repo with ~/.vim/
- Make research defense presentation for ufabc
- Start classes?
- Resolver questao do Vim para ter a produtividade e confortos necessarios

Vim
- see last [[commits]] to understando what has been integrated into Vim.
- Ask list about current milestone in Vim? Bram is commiting daily, so is there a version?
- install with ruby to use notmutch for reading email:
  * https://github.com/felipec/notmuch-vim
* study [[encription]]:
  * make autocommands to autoencrypt .wiki files with blowfish2, c13, zip in some strange sequences and keys.
* Create a mapping that creates the necessary directories (with :!mkdir) and opens the new file (with :e <cfile><CR>) given any filepath under cursor.
* find a dictionary for offline Vim
* organize notations (e.g. from vimrc)
* install a thesaurus for synonymy check
* it work as a charm
* make surround commands. E.g. e and E+any char surrounds word or Word this the char.
* make a mapping to open all ttm files, vimrc, etc‚Ä¶ in a new tab

* terminal job mode in vim also gave errors while merging git repositores with VimL scripts, although merge seemed perfectly ok and Vim kept working as before.

Realcolors:
- Load random colorscheme (from union of items from realcolors, builtin, third party)

[[prv]]:
- make a VimL mask to NLTK.
just wrap with a closure..
let nltk.lfun = tokenize.wordpunkttokenike
let tokens nltk.lrun("this sentence should be tokenized")
Think about extending the model for any module..
E.g. let linspace = pymodule("numpy", "linalg.linspace")
let marray = linspace(2,100,0.1)
