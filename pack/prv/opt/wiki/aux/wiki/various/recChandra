Dear Staff of the "La Caixa" Foundation,

I am a researcher at the computer science and maths institute
of the University of São Paulo (ICMC/USP),
and a researcher and technician at the São Paulo Research Foundation
(FAPESP).
My masters and doctorate degrees in computational, applied and statistical
physics,
were obtained at the
São Carlos Institute of Physics (IFSC/USP), dealing with complexity
in networks and linguistics, linked data, and data visualization and sonification.
I also worked with many companies and State divisions,
such as the Brazilian Presidency and the United Nations Development
Programme (UNDP).

Dr. Viegas made contact with me in 2014 when absorbing complex networks
theory to apply in an indigenous language research.
She was very competent in understanding core concepts and using the tools
needed to reach relevant results for her doctoral thesis.
Dr. Viegas maintained a very good communication with me from then on,
supplying, for me, good insights and novel research methods and results
she found through third party articles.

I believe you will be welcoming a mature and encouraged researcher 
in your program by accepting Dr. Chandra.

Sincerily,
Dr. Renato Fabbri
