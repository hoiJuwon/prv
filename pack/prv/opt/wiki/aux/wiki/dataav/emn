- select vertexes not to be merged
- start by betweenness, neighbors of vertices with high betweenness
- make vertex and edge distribution be followed as closely as possible:
  - |V|/|E| ~ contastant in the MLHierarchy
  - degree distribution be conserved (G_L is an isolated node, optimized by simplicity and computational cost, G_{L-1} has a number of communities that follow the same profile (or a transformed version of it) of degree/strength, etc)
- strategy:
  - select all one degree nodes and remove them or collapse into one node per common neighbor
  - then do the same with nodes with degree 2
  - then with degree 3
  - unting reaching singleton
- use subclassing for different matching strategies. This avoids both having multiple methods or conditionals.
