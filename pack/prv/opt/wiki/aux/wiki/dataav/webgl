WebGL runs on the GPU on your computer. As such you need to provide the code
that runs on that GPU. You provide that code in the form of pairs of functions.
Those 2 functions are called a vertex shader and a fragment shader and they are
each written in a very strictly typed C/C++ like language called GLSL. (GL
Shader Language).

For each thing you want to draw you setup a bunch of state then execute a pair
of functions by calling gl.drawArrays or gl.drawElements which executes your
shaders on the GPU.

1) attributes, buffers, and vertex arrays
2) uniforms
3) textures
4) varyings

WebGL only cares about 2 things. Clipspace coordinates and colors. Your job as a programmer using WebGL is to provide WebGL with those 2 things. You provide your 2 "shaders" to do this. A Vertex shader which provides the clipspace coordinates and a fragment shader that provides the color.

Clipspace coordinates always go from -1 to +1 no matter what size your canvas is.
