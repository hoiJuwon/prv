syllable-accent
words have accents in first syllable.
Therefore, assumed only up to three syllable words.

words have multiple meaning and syntatic roles

.3:
there is no to be
see li

no plural and singula
'as do japanese'

there are no verb tenses

subject clause is first.

verb is second.

li between subject and verb when subject not I (mi) or you (sina)
IMHO li is a "to be". See rule .3:

direct object separated by e and holds what action is done to
action done by subject specified by verb name(s)

the word after the noun/verb qualifies it
adjectives, adverbs, possessives, coumpund nouns (and verbs?)

basic structure: <subject> li <verb> e <object>
li is ommited when subject is simple me (mi) or you (sina).

lon, tawa and kepeken takes a complement and can be a direct verb:
    http://tokipona.net/tp/janpije/okamasona6.php
When action verb there is a direct object and therefore the e

tawa can also be used as an adjective.

sentences are split with 'e ni'

kama can be used as an action verb, followed by tawa and with other verbs to
give a sense of progression.

kama can be used as an action verb, followed by tawa and with other verbs to
give a sense of progression.

kama can be used as an action verb, followed by tawa and with other verbs to
give a sense of progression.

anpa, insa, monsi e sewi are nouns.
should be used with preposition (e.g. lon)

ala negates by coming after the verb or noun.
use plain 'ala' instead of 'ijo ala'

ale means everything
has alias ali

gender is given through meli (female) and mije (male) qualifiers

countries, religions, names are 'unofficial words' 
out of the 124 words in dictionary. there is some convention to unnoficial words:
    http://tokipona.net/tp/janpije/learn.php

unofficial words are capitalized and adapted to toki pona phonetics

unofficial words are used as adjectives.
ma/ma tomo/jan/meli/mije Uwords = country/city/person/man/woman Uword

o follows the name and is followed by a coma when calling someone.
E.g. jan Tanel o, sina wile ala wile kama e sona?

a follows o for emotional emphasis.
E.g. jan Tasi o a!

starts a command.
E.g. o awen. jan Wiso o tawa tomo sina.

interjections of one and two words are possible.
E.g. mu. pona. ike. pakala. mi tawa. kama pona.

any question can be done subsituting the missing pos by seme.
E.g. jan seme li ni? Use ala for questions with yes/no answers.

sin means another or more.
might not fit here as a rule.

pi indicates that the term ahead is qualified by the other terms before it
qualifies the first term.
should only be present if required by the meaning and can be used to denote
possession of items (len pi jan Taj

anu is or, en is and, taso is but or only.
separate sentences for taso. Not clear if anu and an can be used for connecting
verbs with same subject (and object), e.g. mi wile e ken lon e mi.

pilin is used for sentations, feelings and thoughs.

colors are expressed by jelo (yellow), laso (blue) and loje (red) as RGB.
use pi when using anu or en with kule so both colors qualify the referece. E.g.
len pi jelo anu laso

living things imply no new sintatic structures, only semantic (soweli, kasi,
kala, waso, akesi, moli)

body parts have conventions of sike meli being women breasts, not buttchicks,
while penis is palisa mije, not nena mije.
For me the most intuitive would me to have lupa meli (vagina), nena mije (penis), nena
meli (breasts), nena monsi (butt), lupa monsi (anus).

counting is achieved by senquencing wan(1) tu(2) luka(5) mute(20) e ali(100).

ordinals are achieved by using pi numpa <count>.


ken la starts sentences meaning maybe.

tenpo ... la starts sentence with temporal reference of duration or instant.


consequential relations are expressed through a compound clause with la.
E.g. mi kama sona e toki pona la mi toki e toki pona.


comparisons are expressed through duplicated sentences with corresponding
mute/lili.
E.g.  suno li suli mute. mun li suli lili.

jan ale li tawa ike nasin pi tenpo mute 
jan li tawa ike ala, la jan ni li pona suli mute,
linja la ona li jo e wawa pi sijelo ale sina nasin.

sewi li pana ala e kon wawa ala,
taso ona pana e kon pi wawa an olin an sona pali awen.

mi wile kama sona e Jesu,
e wawa tan moli weka ona,
e pali lon pilin ike ona,
linja la li sama e ona lon
moli ona,
tan la li kama jo e moli weka 

nimi li mute la ike li lon,
taso jan pi nasin nena uta li sona.

nimi uta mi li pilin pona tawa sina,
o kiwen mi an jan li kama jo mi tempo pi mute

==========








- <(pro)noun> = <noun_> = <noun>|<pronoun>

- structures:
    <starting_clause> = (<(pro)noun> li)|(mi|sina) + <noun/verb/adjective>
    <be_clause> =  (li + (wile) + <noun/verb/adjective>)*N1
    <direct_o_clause> = (<e <noun/verb/abjective>>)*N2
    sentence = <starting_clause> + <be_clause> + <direct_o_clause>

- coumpund words have standard meanings (e.g. jan sewi = god):
    http://tokipona.net/tp/janpije/okamasona5.php

- possessives are like adjectives (just use the <(pro)noun>

- adverbs follow the verbs

- might be a good idea to look at the frequency of words in english
and use it for translation precedence from toki pona to english.
