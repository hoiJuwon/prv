\begin{abstract}
A minimalist constructed language (conlang)
is useful for experiments and comfortable for making tools.
The Toki Pona (TP) conlang is minimalist both in the vocabulary
(with only 14 letters and 124 words)
and in the (about) 10 syntax rules.
The language is useful for being a used and somewhat established
minimalist conlang with at least hundreds of fluent speakers.
This article exposes current concepts and resources
for TP,
and makes available Python scripted routines for
the analysis of the language,
the synthesis of texts, the specification of syntax highlighting
schemes, and the achievement of a preliminary TP
Wordnet.
Focus is on the analysis of the basic vocabulary,
as corpus analyses were found.
The synthesis is based on sentence templates,
relates to context by keeping track of used words,
and renders larger texts by using a fixed number of phonemes (e.g. for poems)
and number of sentences, words and letters (e.g. for paragraphs).
Syntax highlighting 
reflects morphosyntactic classes given in the official dictionary
and different solutions are described and implemented
in the well-established Vim text editor.
The tentative TP Wordnet is made available in three patterns
  of relations between synsets and word lemmas.
In summary, this text holds potentially novel conceptualizations about,
and tools and results in analyzing, synthesizing and syntax highlighting the
TP language.
