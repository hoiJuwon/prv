\caption{"POS tags incident and chosen as preferential e.g. in text synthesis.
                    The official dictionary often relates tokens
                    to more than one POS tag.
                    For the text highlighting Plugin, for example,
                    a token has to have an established tag to have
                    a defined color.
                    On the Chosen column, the tokens were regarded only once
                    by choosing the first occurrence of ['PRE', 'VERB', 'PREPOSITION', 'PARTICLE', 'ADJECTIVE', 'NOUN', 'NUMBER'] in the official dictionary.}\label{foobar}
