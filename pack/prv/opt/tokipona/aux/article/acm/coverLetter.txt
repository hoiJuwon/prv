Dear Editor,

the manuscript reports novel tools and conceptualizations
about a minimal constructed language called Toki Pona.
The topic is therefore both generic and specialized,
and may be of interest for researchers in many fields.
I also highlight important results that arouse from this study:

- the language is described in-depth, both considering the official
  norms and the usage practices.
- Meaningful and basic statistics are exposed and contextualized.
- Syntax highlighting in provided and a routine to specify arbitrary schemes.
- Toki Pona text synthesis routines are provided, ranging from simple
  phrases to decasyllable poems.
- Three preliminary Toki Pona wordnets are provided.

Finally, the methods employed (including the software developed) will
be useful for researcher dealing with constructed languages, Toki
Pona, text synthesis, and other subjects.

Yours sincerely,

Renato Fabbri
