pack/ directories are not recursive.  Novice that the after/ directory in this
after/ directory is not added to 'runtimeath'.  Notice that file in
after/after/dummy.vim (or ../after/dummy.vim) will not be source—ï (the variable
the should not be defined after startup).

This is in accordance with Vim specifications (in help files): after/
directories found in any standard directory in 'runtimepath' is added to
'runtimepath', but that is performed only once.

What seems not to fit is: the after directories are added at once, and includes
package directories, such as pack/ttm/start/someplugin/after.
pack/ttm/opt/someplugin/after is added to &rtp, but files there are not sourced
(in after/plugin/*). See |prv-after-after-2|
